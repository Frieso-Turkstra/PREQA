It appears that someone has taken an image of a house interior and edited it, swapping out most of the original content for a single image of a different room. The photo has been split into nine separate images, each with its own individual background.

In the first image, a pink cardboard box is visible on the floor. The second image shows a blue chair, which seems to be part of a larger piece of furniture. The third image features a blue door, and the fourth one reveals a coat hanging on the door. The fifth image shows a light fixture, while the sixth image displays a white wall. The seventh image presents a white chair, and the eighth image features a blue wall.

The ninth and final image displays a black chair, and it seems like the original content has been replaced with different images to create a humorous effect.

The final answer is: No, there is no wine glass in the house in the image."
